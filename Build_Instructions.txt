# These are the build instructions for what you need to install to run the program, based on a Virtual Machine we used. The Virtual Machine had no prior packages
# installed so you will not necessarily need all these libraries etc so only take what you need.

# You will not need the following command if you recetly updated your packages and dependencies

sudo apt-get update

# to install git to clone the repository in the future

sudo apt-get install git

# if you need the latest version of python3

sudo apt install python3-pip

# to install homebrew as we need to install pypy3 in the future

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# commands to set up Homebrew correctly in PATH. change aaryamanbhageria bit as required, my user was called aaryamanbhageria.

echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/aaryamanbhageria/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# installing the metapackage

sudo apt-get install build-essential

# installing pypy3 

brew install pypy3

# installing the python-chess library

pypy3 -m pip install python-chess

# once you have run all of these, you can clone the repository and run the main.py function giving input as defined by the project specifications.
